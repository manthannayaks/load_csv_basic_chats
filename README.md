CSV Data Analysis and Visualization

Overview

This project analyzes a CSV dataset using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries. It loads the dataset, performs basic statistical analysis, and visualizes the data using bar charts, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Features

Load and display CSV data

Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)

Check for missing values

Create visualizations:

Bar Chart for categorical data distribution

Scatter Plot for relationships between numerical values

Heatmap for correlaCSV Data Analysis and Visualization

Visualize the Data

Generates graphs to better understand the dataset.

How to Run the Code

Install the required libraries (if not installed):

pip install pandas matplotlib numpy

Place your CSV file in the project folder.

Open and run the Python script.

View the generated statistical insights and visualizations.

Sample Output

The program will display:

A table of statistical insights (mean, min, max, etc.).

Graphs showing trends and distributions in the data.

Applications

Can be used for data analysis projects in various fields.

Helps in understanding patterns and relationships in datasets.
